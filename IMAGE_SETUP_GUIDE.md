# How to Add Your College Images

## Current Status
✅ The website is now working with temporary placeholder images
✅ All images are visible and the website loads properly

## To Add Your Actual Images:

### Option 1: Replace Placeholder Files (Recommended)
1. Rename your images to exactly these names:
   - `college-logo.jpg` (your college logo)
   - `college-image.jpg` (your college building/campus)
   - `learning-image.jpg` (your students learning image)

2. Copy these renamed files to: `d:\chatbot for college website\collage-chatbot\images\`

3. Update the HTML file to use local images:
   - In `index.html`, change the image sources back to:
     - `src="images/college-logo.jpg"`
     - `src="images/college-image.jpg"`
     - `src="images/learning-image.jpg"`

### Option 2: Keep Current Setup
